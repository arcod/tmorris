			<p>Thomas Morrison is a musician and teacher based in Portland, Oregon. He offers quality piano instruction in classical, jazz, blues, folk, rock/pop for students ages 5 to adult.</p>

<p>Tom studied Classical piano beginning at an early age, and earned multiple honors as a young performer at the local and statewide level. Equipped with this foundation in the Classical tradition, Tom’s musical interests subsequently broadened to include Jazz, Rock, and Soul music. Along the way, he developed a deep fascination for other keyboard instruments such as the electric organ and the synthesizer. In 2010, Tom graduated from Reed College with a Bachelor’s of Music degree and began teaching professionally in the Portland area. As a professional keyboardist/bassist, Tom routinely performs locally and on tour throughout the West and the East coast. He has maintained his independent teaching practice steadily since 2012.</p>
